I had no issues following the tutorial about the maze creation. Everything works smooth and fine. I followed instructions step by step except for the grid scale, since I had to adapt my floor and walls assets. 
The assets I used are from the "Low Poly Cartoon House Interiors" package, a VR-ready good looking package I bought on the asset store.

The only "issue" I encountered is about the renderer of the raycast line. I can't find the material to convert it to my rendering pipeline.
